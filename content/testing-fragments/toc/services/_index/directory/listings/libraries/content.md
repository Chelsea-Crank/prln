### Syna & Fragments

Fragments are the base building block of your website.
Each page is made up of one or multiple fragments. 
These can be a navigation fragment, a content fragment and more.

#### Where to put the fragments

In Hugo, the simplest way to create a page is to create a directory containing an `index.md` file.
