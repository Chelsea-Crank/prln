Once you have completed the GSL Family Literacy Certification program, you will be certified to deliver GSL at your own agency. You will know more about Family Literacy and how to incorporate these practices into your own work. You will also have access to all the resources needed to run a GSL program, for example:

- Printable curriculum for facilitators, parents, children, and childcare workers
- Sample contracts and MOUâ€™s
- Sample budgets for planning
- Promotional materials like logo, brand identity guidelines, buck cards and posters

You will be required to maintain your certification by re-certifying in 2 to 3 years and taking ongoing training with Project READ about family literacy and related concepts. As a certified individual, the ongoing training will be offered to you at a reduced fee or it may even be free to you.
