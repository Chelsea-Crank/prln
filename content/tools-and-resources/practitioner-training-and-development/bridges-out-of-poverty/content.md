Here are some ideas to consider when working with those living in poverty, based on the framework for understanding poverty by Ruby Payne[^1]


### Poverty can be passed from generation to generation
Inter-generational poverty occurs when more than one generation in a family lives in poverty consecutively. The conditions that create poverty can be passed from one generation to the next for a number of reasons. Here are a few:

- Parents may undervalue education because of their own negative experiences, and pass this attitude to their child.
- Parents may not have the physical and emotional resources to nurture their child to be able to develop and learn in healthy ways.
- Parents may teach their child, overtly or inadvertently, that there is no way out of poverty.

A person who has grown up believing that it is their lot to be poor can find it very hard to change this belief. In fact they may appear resigned or comfortable remaining in their situation, because they have learned that change can disrupt what little security they have and may bring more hardship than they already manage.

### Poverty requires survival thinking and survival skills
After preparing for a class it can be frustrating when families don’t attend. But those who live in poverty face challenges it is impossible to imagine unless you have lived in that situation. For a family living in poverty, just meeting day to day needs may present all-consuming challenges. Attending a program or fulfilling other responsibilities may take a back seat to finding food for supper.

### Poverty creates a world-view which eliminates future planning
Adults who live in poverty must learn to deal with crises on a moment-to-moment basis. For example, on the same day a person living in poverty may have to fight an eviction notice, find a way to get their child to the doctor, and get a friend to drive them to the food bank. When all of a person’s energy is focused on the immediate challenges of the present moment, future thinking or planning, even for tomorrow, becomes virtually impossible.

### Poverty leads people to value relationships over other considerations
When a person has no monetary security, relationships become their currency. Relationships may offer the only comfort and stability they can attain. Friends and family members are highly valued for any support. A parent living in poverty may appear deeply attached to their child and may struggle with discipline and with separation.

### Poverty may lead to mistrust of the middle-class
A person living in poverty will have encountered negative responses from others. They may have had trouble finding support or services to help them or have experienced discrimination from those meant to offer support. Naturally, they might build up mistrust for anyone they view in the same social group as those who have treated them poorly. They may feel (accurately) that others can’t understand their lives.

### Poverty can affect health, and mental health
With low literacy skills can come struggles with health. For example, low literacy skills may mean a person cannot look up health information, advocate for themselves at the doctor’s office, or read directions on their prescription.

Living in poverty can increase the likelihood of mental health disorders, as day to day struggles or lack of hope for the future can lead to depression and other conditions.

When families live in poverty, children can also be affected by health and mental health difficulties. Children will adopt the mind-set of their parents and may come to believe that higher education or a way out of poverty is beyond their grasp. Their attitude to learning may be affected, which can lead to obstacles to learning. As well, health and mental health issues can affect their ability to learn.

### Poverty affects learning
Often poverty results in, or is the result of, lack of opportunity for education.

#### Poverty can be part of a chain or cycle:

- difficulty in school can result in early drop out
- early drop out can result in low literacy skills
- low literacy skills can result in inability to find adequate work
- inability to find adequate work leads to poverty
- poverty leads to difficulty in school
  
Children living in poverty may experience health and mental health issues, attitudes or beliefs, and physical challenges which affect their ability to learn. For example, a child who is hungry can’t learn at the same rate as one who is not. Children living in poverty have decreased opportunity for success in school.

### What you can do
You cannot fix a family’s situation. But your work with parents will make a difference in their lives.

- Recognize that you cannot possibly know how they feel and what struggles they may face.
- Understand that families may have trouble trusting you. You are a representative from a group of authority figures that have not served them well.
- Listen and sympathize to build trust.
- Realize that absenteeism is not a result of laziness or lack of commitment.
- Watch for your own biases or tendency to discriminate, and correct them as you go. We all deal with these responses.
- Offer parents help and support with finding ways to continue their education or employment, without judgement if they don’t follow up now.
- Remember that planning for the future may be hard right now, if not impossible.
- Call or text with a friendly reminder the day before each Get Set Learn class to help families stay on track and keep lines of communication open.
- Praise parents for all they are doing to help their child learn and get ready for school. Their efforts will benefit their child.
