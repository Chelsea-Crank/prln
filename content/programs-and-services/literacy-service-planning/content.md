The Literacy Service Plan is created annually by Project READ  and the Literacy Service Planning Committee through Service Coordination and System Planning.  Each Adult Literacy and Basic Skills (LBS) program in Waterloo-Wellington is represented on the committee.  We work in collaboration to develop a Literacy Service Plan to meet the literacy needs of our community.

For more information on the the Local Literacy Programs that we work with, please see [The Directory of Programs](/programs-and-services/directory-of-programs/).
