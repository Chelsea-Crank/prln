# Get a job

</summary>

If you receive social assistance:

The Region of Waterloo and Wellington County offer courses and workshops to help people get a job. Ask your worker about the programs you can take to help you get ready for work or get a job.

If you do not receive social assistance:

Contact Agilec (formerly Northern Lights) to ask about programs to help you get ready for work or get a job.

http://www.agilec.ca/

These programs will help you find out what job you would be suited for, figure out what skills you need, get training if you need it, make a resume, and find jobs to apply for.

Do not pay for an online course without checking into it first! Some of these courses are a scam. Contact Agilec to ask about whether a course is legitimate or not.
