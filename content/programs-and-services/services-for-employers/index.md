<!--more-->

We support employers to identify literacy needs in their workforce through organizational needs assessments and information packages. <!--more--> We try to demystify literacy issues and how they affect health and safety, productivity, and employer-worker relations. Project READ can facilitate the referral of workers to literacy programs in the community or help the employer to choose a trainer to provide a workplace literacy/education  program on-site
