We support employers to identify literacy needs in their workforce through organizational needs assessments and information packages.  
  
We try to demystify literacy issues and how they affect health and safety, productivity, and employer-worker relations.  
  
Project READ can facilitate the referral of workers to literacy programs in the community or help the employer to choose a trainer to provide a workplace literacy/education  program on-site.
