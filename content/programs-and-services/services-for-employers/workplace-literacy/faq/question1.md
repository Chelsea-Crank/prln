1 out of 3 Canadian employers experience basic skills-related problems with their workforce, yet less than 1 out of 10 employers are involved in literacy programs or referrals to programs.[^1] The impact of Basic Skills Programs on Canadian Workplace, by the Workplace Education Center of ABC CANADA, reports on 86 employer and employee representatives from 53 workplaces which had participated in basic skills training for at least 1 year:

- 79% reported increased productivity
- 84% reported improvements in the quality of people’s work
- 73% reported an increase in the work effort
- 87% reported more competent use of workplace based technology
- 82% reported increased health and safety
- 97% reported increased self confidence that benefits the workplace  
  
When 600 managers from a broad spectrum of Canadian industries were surveyed, about 1/3 of them reported that poor literacy caused serious difficulty with:

- Introducing new technology
- Product quality
- Productivity
[^2]
  
The estimated annual cost of low literacy to Canadian business is $1.6 billion for industrial accidents alone. This does not include the cost of illiteracy from lost productivity in other areas.[^3]
