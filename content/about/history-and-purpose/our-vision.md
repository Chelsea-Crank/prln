### Project READ is committed to building healthy and confident communities through literacy and essential skills training.
With our expertise, broad community network, resources, and years of experience serving diverse literacy needs, Project READ is a lead source for family literacy services and education in Waterloo-Wellington. Through intergenerational programs, Project READ is helping families build their literacy skills together. In return, parents and caring adults are given the skills needed to pursue their own educational or employment goals while better preparing their children for success in school. We are committed to ensuring that every individual has access to literacy and essential skills training needed to learn, grow, and flourish.
