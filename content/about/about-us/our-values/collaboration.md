# Collaboration
### We strive to build relationships to further the improvement of Literacy in Waterloo-Wellington.

</summary>

***

 We are a dynamic community collaboration that works hard to find the best resources to help adults and families with their literacy and essential skills needs. We develop, in collaboration with the local Literacy & Basic Skills (LBS) agencies, training solutions to meet the literacy needs of our citizens. Our resourceful network includes literacy agencies, English as a second language programs, libraries, employment training organizations, and other advocates.
