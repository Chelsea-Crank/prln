# Resourceful
### We are a dynamic community collaboration that works hard to find the best resources to help adults and families with their literacy and essential skills needs.

***

We develop, in collaboration with the local [Literacy & Basic Skills (LBS) agencies](#), training solutions to meet the literacy needs of our citizens. Our resourceful network includes literacy agencies, English as a second language programs, libraries, employment training organizations, and other advocates.

We are a forward thinking organization that uses research and community input to identify the literacy needs of our community, both in the present and the future. We are creative problem solvers and community connectors that work hard to find solutions, explain options, and connect people with the best resources to help them achieve their literacy goals
