# What is Literacy?
### Literacy is more than knowing how to read and write.

</summary>

***

A person who is literate can use reading, writing, speaking, and numerical skills effectively to understand and participate in the world around them.

Literacy is not a fixed skill. It needs to be exercised and challenged. Otherwise, the skill will not strengthen and may weaken.

There are 5 levels to define literacy in Canada. A person may be able to function at one of the lower levels, but would still be considered to have problems with literacy.
