# What is Family Literacy?

### Key message: Parents are their child’s first and most important teacher.

</summary>

***

Project READ defines “family literacy” as: Parents actively helping themselves and their children to become lifelong learners through a wide variety of daily activities.  

Project READ defines “family literacy programming” as: Programs that focus on building the already-present strengths within families by working with parents to aid in developing their child’s literacy skills and their own.  By using supports from adult literacy, early childhood education, and family support, [family literacy programs](/programs-and-services/programs-for-families/) help parents to support their children as they develop literacy and math skills that will provide a foundation for the child’s future success.
