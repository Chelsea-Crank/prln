Project READ Literacy Network was founded on September 7, 1988 by the literacy agencies in Waterloo Region. They wanted a central agency to share information, coordinate efforts and provide outreach. In 1995, Project READ extended its boundary to include Guelph-Wellington. Since its beginning, the network has been devoted to promoting literacy issues and programs to the community, bringing literacy practitioners together, and improving service delivery. This mandate of information and support remains the heart of the organization.
