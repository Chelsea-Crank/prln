## Why Project READ Literacy Network Matters

Founded in 1988, Project READ Literacy Network is a doorway to literacy and Essential Skills services offered in our Waterloo-Wellington. Project READ believes that literacy and Essential Skills are necessary for an individual to reach their full potential and function independently. Low literacy affects many aspects of life including, health, income, employment, parenting, education and daily living; Literacy matters. Through our network and programs, we are dedicated to providing our community with:

## Our Mission
##### Project READ Literacy Network is committed to providing any adult or family in Waterloo Wellington with access to literacy training.

## Our Vision
##### Project READ is committed to building healthy and confident communities through literacy and essential skills training.
With our expertise, broad community network, resources, and years of experience serving diverse literacy needs, Project READ is a lead source for family literacy services and education in Waterloo-Wellington. Through intergenerational programs, Project READ is helping families build their literacy skills together. In return, parents and caring adults are given the skills needed to pursue their own educational or employment goals while better preparing their children for success in school. We are committed to ensuring that every individual has access to literacy and essential skills training needed to learn, grow, and flourish. 

## Who we are
##### These big ideas are characteristics we strive to embody when communicating and interacting with our community, partners and stakeholders.

#### Welcoming
Project READ is dedicated to serving our diverse community. We strive to invite and greet everyone with care and open-mindedness. Through our services and programs, we pride ourselves on creating positive, safe, and inclusive experiences where adults and families can gain the confidence needed to improve their literacy and better their lives.

#### Resourceful
We are a dynamic community collaboration that works hard to find the best resources to help adults and families with their literacy and essential skills needs. We develop, in collaboration with the local Literacy & Basic Skills (LBS) agencies, training solutions to meet the literacy needs of our citizens. Our resourceful network includes literacy agencies, English as a second language programs, libraries, employment training organizations, and other advocates.

We are a forward thinking organization that uses research and community input to identify the literacy needs of our community, both in the present and the future. We are creative problem solvers and community connectors that work hard to find solutions, explain options, and connect people with the best resources to help them achieve their literacy goals.
 
#### Holistic
We believe in the whole individual and all that comes with them. Building literacy and essential skills can not be separated from the other aspects of an individual's dynamics and development. In order to make this happen, we collaborate with local organizations that support our community in different ways. From mental health and family and childrens services, to cultural groups and neighbourhood associations, we work together to support individuals and families as a whole. 
 
The holistic approach of attending programs and accessing resources, as an individual or with others, creates an experience that fosters a cycle of learning, collective growth and responsibility for more than one generation. 
 
#### Life-long learner
We are advocates of life-long learning and believe in the positive impact it has on individual and community wellbeing. Our agency works hard to provide information to the public, research and development to the literacy field, and support to Literacy and Basic Skills agencies in our region and across Ontario. 
Our resources and programs are backed by the latest research and knowledge around literacy needs, theories, and applications. We test, explore, and research sustainable resources, strategies, and programs that positively impact and increase literacy levels across Waterloo Region.
Through our services and programs, we strive to foster a passion for life-long learning. Literacy education helps individuals build confidence, relationships and creates a sense of belonging.

## What is Family Literacy?
##### Parents are their child’s first and most important teacher.

Parents actively helping themselves and their children to become lifelong learners through a wide variety of daily activities. Children learn literacy skills starting at birth, in the home, with a parent as the child’s first teacher.

## What is Literacy?
##### Literacy is more than knowing how to read and write.

A person who is literate can use reading, writing, speaking, and numerical skills effectively to understand and participate in the world around them.

Literacy is not a fixed skill. It needs to be exercised and challenged. Otherwise, the skill will not strengthen and may weaken.

There are 5 levels to define literacy in Canada. A person may be able to function at one of the lower levels, but would still be considered to have problems with literacy. Please see our literacy levels page for definitions of these levels. See our facts page for information on general literacy statistics.
