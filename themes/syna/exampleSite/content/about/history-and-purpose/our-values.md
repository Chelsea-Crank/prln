### These big ideas are characteristics we strive to embody when communicating and interacting with our community, partners and stakeholders.

#### Welcoming
Project READ is dedicated to serving our diverse community. We strive to invite and greet everyone with care and open-mindedness. Through our services and programs, we pride ourselves on creating positive, safe, and inclusive experiences where adults and families can gain the confidence needed to improve their literacy and better their lives.

#### Resourceful
We are a dynamic community collaboration that works hard to find the best resources to help adults and families with their literacy and essential skills needs. We develop, in collaboration with the local [Literacy & Basic Skills (LBS) agencies](#), training solutions to meet the literacy needs of our citizens. Our resourceful network includes literacy agencies, English as a second language programs, libraries, employment training organizations, and other advocates.

We are a forward thinking organization that uses research and community input to identify the literacy needs of our community, both in the present and the future. We are creative problem solvers and community connectors that work hard to find solutions, explain options, and connect people with the best resources to help them achieve their literacy goals.
 
#### Holistic
We believe in the whole individual and all that comes with them. Building literacy and essential skills can not be separated from the other aspects of an individual's dynamics and development. In order to make this happen, we collaborate with local organizations that support our community in different ways. From mental health and family and childrens services, to cultural groups and neighbourhood associations, we work together to support individuals and families as a whole. 
 
The holistic approach of attending programs and accessing resources, as an individual or with others, creates an experience that fosters a cycle of learning, collective growth and responsibility for more than one generation. 
 
#### Life-long learner
We are advocates of life-long learning and believe in the positive impact it has on individual and community wellbeing. Our agency works hard to provide information to the public, research and development to the literacy field, and support to Literacy and Basic Skills agencies in our region and across Ontario. 
Our resources and programs are backed by the latest research and knowledge around literacy needs, theories, and applications. We test, explore, and research sustainable resources, strategies, and programs that positively impact and increase literacy levels across Waterloo Region.
Through our services and programs, we strive to foster a passion for life-long learning. Literacy education helps individuals build confidence, relationships and creates a sense of belonging.
